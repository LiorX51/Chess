This chess program consists of two main programs:

One for the FrontEnd where the user is able to see and interact.
The second one is the Backend where the user has no accses to and it contronls all the back stuff.

The FrontEnd and the Backend connect when they both open at the same time.

For the program to work the FrontEnd must be reconfuigerd and changed by the worker.
